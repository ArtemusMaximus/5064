title: "Meet our 2014 bot, Vlad the Impaler"

<p>This here is Vlad the Impaler, though we just call him Vlad as to not scare everyone away from him. Don’t worry he won’t impale you we promise! His loading claws may just line up perfectly with holes in his robot counterparts frames. Anyway on to what he can actually do! Vlad was designed to shoot a two foot yoga ball into a seven foot tall goal or push it into goals along the ground. We also tried to make him a team player and able to  pass it to other robots on his team. In designing him we tried to keep his weight and speed balanced so he could get around the field quickly while having weight to take hits and also to hit other robots in a defender mode.</p>

<h2>Frame and Drive</h2>
<p>Vlad is the max perimeter of an FRC robot being 112 inches from his extremities. He’s a square 27.5 by 28.5 inches with the front base plate set 7 inches into his frame creating a nice cozy place for the ball to rest. We used the provided FRC stock frame and drive and added a second set of sim motors to drive its 6WD yes 6WD not 4WD into overdrive and letting him reach speeds of approximately 20 km/h.</p>

<h2>Launch and Load</h2>
<p>Within Vlad's front indent is a set of loading claws attached to a steel bar and mounted on a motor which spins them up and down. To control this motion on the programming side is a magnet sensor to sense what position these arms are in. Once a ball is loaded onto these arms they spin up depositing the ball inside a 4 foot tall cage mounted on our drive frame. The ball is now resting on our launching mechanism a set of arms attached to two large stroke pneumatic pistons which smash the arms down and launch the ball up and out. To stop dry fires a ultrasonic sensor is set inside the belly of the beast among criss crossing wires and electronic components. It constantly checks whether a ball is loaded and only when one is will Vlad be able to fire. To aim this launch the entire 4 foot cage is able to tilt via a linear actuator mounted to the frame and pushing on the side of the cage.</p>
