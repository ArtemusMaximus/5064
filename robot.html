title: "Meet our 2014 bot, Vlad the Impaler"
description:

<p>This is our robot Vlad the Impaler. Vlad was designed to shoot a two foot yoga ball into a seven foot tall goal or push it into a goal at ground level. Vlad is also a team player and is able to pass the ball it to other robots on his team. To allow Vlad to move fast while having weight to take hits and tackle other robots we have balanced his weight and speed.</p>

<dt>Frame and Drive</dt>
<dd>Vlad’s drive train is located in a square base with a launcher cage positioned on top making the robot just under 4 feet tall. Four drive motors power six wheels allowing Vlad to reach speeds of 20 km/h.</dd>

<dt>Launch and Load</dt>
<dd>At the front of Vlad is a set of arms connected to a motor which moves them up and down. To control this motion we use a magnet sensor to keep track of what position the arms are in. Once a ball is loaded onto the arms they move up placing the ball inside the cage. This cage is able to tilt allowing us to aim the ball prior to launch. The launching mechanism consists of two pneumatic pistons that launch the ball out of the cage.</dd> 
<dt>Pneumatics</dt>
<dd>The pneumatics are used for firing the ball and are powered by two air storage tanks. To fill the air tanks we use an air compressor. The compressed air is used in two pneumatic pistons, one controlling a firing pin and the other controlling the launcher arms.</dd> 
<dt>Electronics</dt>
<dd>Vlad’s brain is a cRIO microprocessor. Connected to this processing unit is a digital motor controller, an analog input to collect data from sensors, and a relay module to control the pneumatic systems. We used a variety of motor controllers including for controlling the pneumatics, driver motors and the motors controlling the tilting and lifting operations of the launch cage. To distribute the power from the battery and to limit it to a safe voltage all electronic are connected to a Power Distribution Board that all electronic are connected to.</dd>
