- Not ready yet!
- Projected "release" date May 8 (Next Wednesday)
- Mario responsible for web site, but...
- will be managed by students in Marketing & Branding subteam (one day)

# Marketing & Branding subteam
- Develop and maintain team's web site, produce swag and flair
- Address *issues* (bugs, typos, errors, etc) as reported in the Issue Tracking System
- ICT credits (COM 1055, COM 2055, COM 3075, COM 3155,...)
- We need a Marketing & Branding Captain today (deadlines are approaching)!

# ...everyone else
- Providing sensible ideas and constructive feedback on website 

# Reporting *issues*
- Report bugs, typos etc. using **only** the issue tracking system (do not email or post on FB)
- Important stuff to keep in mind when using the issue tracking system:
 - Be specific and accurate (because if we cannot find/reproduce the bug/typo/issue we cannot fix it)
 - Be civil, courteous and professional (everything posted is public and has the potential to haunt you for the rest of your life)
 - Keep it short, but not too short!
- [Issue tracking system demo](http://5064.ca/)
