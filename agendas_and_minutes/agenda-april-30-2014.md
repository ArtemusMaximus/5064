# Team web site: [www.5064.ca](http://www.5064.ca)
- Not ready yet!
- Projected "release" date May 8 (Next Wednesday)

- site will be managed by students in Marketing & Branding subteam (one day)

# Marketing & Branding subteam
- Develop and maintain team's web site, produce swag and flair
- Address *issues* (bugs, typos, errors, etc) as reported in the Issue Tracking System
- CTS credits (e.g. COM 1055, COM 2055, COM 3075, COM 3155,...)
- We need a Marketing & Branding Captain today (deadlines are approaching) - anyone interested in being the Marketing & Branding Captain - talk to me before you leave today.
- Marketing & Branding subteam will meet weekly (separately from our Wed 4-6 meetings)

# ...everyone else (i.e. students + mentors)
- Check out web site and providing sensible ideas and constructive feedback using the official Issue Tracking System

# Reporting *issues*
- Report bugs, typos etc. using **only** the issue tracking system (do not email or post on FB)
- Important stuff to keep in mind when using the issue tracking system:
 - Be specific and accurate (because if we cannot find/reproduce the bug/typo/issue we cannot fix it)
 - Be civil, respectful and professional (everything posted is public and inappropriate comments may come back and haunt you)
 - Keep it short, but not too short!
- [Issue tracking system demo](http://5064.ca/)
