<p>Mentoring is a rewarding experience that lets you collaborate and help students achieve their goals. Mentors can provide help like technical (engineering / programming) training, organisation (planning, financial, etc.) or just general support (keep students on track, track goals, etc.). Mentors mean the world to students, and you will be able to learn and experience a variety of challenges with students.</p>

<p>Mentors share their expertise, skills and enthusiasm with the students in the team. Through the students mentors are the key ingredient in the success of our team. The time commitments, responsibility and expertise of mentors will depending on their skills, expertise and time availability. Mentors report to the Management Team and the Team Director.</p>

Report to: Team Captains, Management Team and Team Director 
...

{% include h4.html txt="Parents" id="parents" %}
Parents/guardians are an integral part of our team and important to our success. The robotics 
team becomes a family throughout the year because the members spend a lot of time together. 
The students learn about hard work, perseverance, commitment, patience, joy, defeat, computer 
skills, respect, engineering, writing, interviewing, business skills, money management, marketing, 
production, publishing, kindness, time management, and most importantly, gracious 
professionalism. Having the involvement of their parents will only enhance this experience for 
them. 
Requirements for parents/guardians are listed in section 3.1.6 above. In addition, some things 
the team needs from parents are: 

<ul>
<li>Providing timely transport for their student to/from team events and community services (this may include car-pooling.</li>
<li>Assisting and supporting their student in fundraising, robor demo and community service activities.</li>
<li>Providing accurate medical information for their student, and keeping the Management Team and/or Team Director informed of any changes.</li>
<li>Participating in any team activities - it really helps to have parents present at these events! Parents are frequently needed to transaport the robot(s) and students to and from demos, to provide adult supervision, etc.</li>
<li>Chaperoning team trips. </li>
<li>Helping your student organize an event or activity.</li>
<li>Mentoring.</li>
<li>Administrative duties (Patron Drive, Awards Submission, Marketing, PR, etc.)</li>
</ul>

Any and all support that can be provided by you and your family, as well as new ideas, is 
welcome. Every person has unique attributes that can be put to use for the good of our team. 
NEMO (Non-Engineering Mentor Organization, www.firstnemo.org) helps parents volunteer with 
FIRST even if they’re not involved with the robot. NEMO has a list that shows 101 ways that 
parents can help a FIRST team at:
