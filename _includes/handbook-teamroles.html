{% include h4.html txt="Mentors" id="mentors" %}
<p>Mentoring is a rewarding experience enabling adults to collaborate and help students achieve their full potential as well as experience many of the same challenges the students are facing. Mentors can provide a wide range of different help to students, e.g. technical training, organisational training (planning, financial, etc.) or general support (keep students on track, track goals, preparing meals, chaperoning, etc.). Mentors share their expertise, skills and enthusiasm with the students in the team. Through the students mentors are the key ingredient in the success of our team. Mentors report to the Management Team and the Team Director.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Team Captains" id="teamcaptains" %}
<p>Team captains are usually student members in good standing that have been with the team through at least one season, but in exceptional circumstance rookie students may be qualified as well. Team Captains are in charge of specific sub-teams within the team and report to the Management Team and Team Director. Our team has the following Team Captain positions:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Safety Captain</dt>
  <dd>The Safety Captain position is a required position by <em>FIRST</em> and plays an integral part in ensuring the safety of everyone at the team and visitors during the teams day-to-day activities and during competitions. The Safety Captains responsibilities are to coordinate, deliver, and track safety training for the individual team members, maintain a log of documenting infractions and/or the need for continuing improvements to individual and the team safety, ensure safe practices are in use at all times and that each workshop/pit area remains safe, conduct safety inspections of the general work site, especially the robot construction area and at the pit station during competition events, encourage your team to display positive safety behaviours at all times, know where to find and become familiar with the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and first aid kits and related emergency procedures, and be prepared to informally present the team's safety program to Safety Advisors at competition.

Report to: Team Captains, Management Team and Team Director 
...

{% include h4.html txt="Parents" id="parents" %}
Parents/guardians are an integral part of our team and important to our success. The robotics 
team becomes a family throughout the year because the members spend a lot of time together. 
The students learn about hard work, perseverance, commitment, patience, joy, defeat, computer 
skills, respect, engineering, writing, interviewing, business skills, money management, marketing, 
production, publishing, kindness, time management, and most importantly, gracious 
professionalism. Having the involvement of their parents will only enhance this experience for 
them. 
Requirements for parents/guardians are listed in section 3.1.6 above. In addition, some things 
the team needs from parents are: 

<ul>
<li>Providing timely transport for their student to/from team events and community services (this may include car-pooling.</li>
<li>Assisting and supporting their student in fundraising, robor demo and community service activities.</li>
<li>Providing accurate medical information for their student, and keeping the Management Team and/or Team Director informed of any changes.</li>
<li>Participating in any team activities - it really helps to have parents present at these events! Parents are frequently needed to transaport the robot(s) and students to and from demos, to provide adult supervision, etc.</li>
<li>Chaperoning team trips. </li>
<li>Helping your student organize an event or activity.</li>
<li>Mentoring.</li>
<li>Administrative duties (Patron Drive, Awards Submission, Marketing, PR, etc.)</li>
</ul>

Any and all support that can be provided by you and your family, as well as new ideas, is 
welcome. Every person has unique attributes that can be put to use for the good of our team. 
NEMO (Non-Engineering Mentor Organization, www.firstnemo.org) helps parents volunteer with 
FIRST even if they’re not involved with the robot. NEMO has a list that shows 101 ways that 
parents can help a FIRST team at:
