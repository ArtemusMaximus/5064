<p>The official name of Opcom's FRC team is <strong>Team 5064</strong>, or if there is a need to clarify the nature of our team, <strong>FRC Team 5064</strong>. This is a permanent name that remains the same from year to year. In addition each season the students participating in Team 5064 may choose their own name for the team that reflects the individuality and character of the team during the specific season. The student selected name can be used on team shirts, buttons and on the team's Facebook page as long as it is accompanied by the official team name Team 5064 and a the url to the team's web site (<a href="http://www.5064.ca">www.5064.ca</a>). At certain official functions (e.g. communication with sponsors), however, the team will be referred to as Team 5064. The decision of which name to use in a given situation is at the discretion of the Team Director and/or Team Coordinator.</p>
