<p>The meeting schedules are posted on the teams facebook group (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/opcomrobotics/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/opcomrobotics/</a>). The team meets year-round with varying frequency by the seasons. The various FRC seasons are the pre-season, build season, competition season, and post-season. Students are required to be activelly involved during all seasons to optimize their experience on the team and to prepare for the critical build and competition season. We recruit new students and mentors throughout the year and require both students and mentors to commit for a minimum of a whole year.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Pre-season (September to December)" id="preseason" %}
<p>Before the official build season, teams will make preparations. Fundraising, off-season events, 
community outreach and service, sub-team training, prototypes and much more is all done before the 
build season. Some teams spend even more time outside of build season. Many important 
technical and non-technical skills are learnt during the off-season. Students are required to attend at least 60% of the meeting hours during the pre-season.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Build season (January - mid-February)" id="buildseason" %}
<p>During the build season, the six weeks following the kickoff, the teams begin to design a 
robot that is able to play the game, essentially from scratch. Team members typically 
spend the time designing strategies to play the game, drawing up ideas for robot parts, 
using Computer Aided Design (CAD) to prototype, working with size and weight constraints, and 
finally, building and assembling their robot. Other challenges include gaining driver 
experience, building the electronics for the robot, and software development. After the build season has ended (usually the 3rd full week of February), teams must stop work on 
their robot before transporting it to the location of their first competition.
During build season, students organize their time and resources to complete a very 
complex task in a short amount of time. They learn technical skills like CAD, fabrication, 
programming, electronics and strategy. Many students go out of their way to complete 
not required challenges just to gain competitive advantages.</p>

<p>The build season is the busiest time of year with meetings taking place at least three times a week, but often more, including during weekends. Additional meetings are scheduled on an as-needed basis for the various subgroups. It is important for all students and mentors to attend these meeting since we only have a short amount of time to create, debug a working robot and driver training. Due to this short time period students are required to attend and participate in at least 90% of the meeting hours during the build season.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Competition (mid-February – end of April)" id="competitionseason" %}
<p>During the competition season meeting times usually follow the build season schedule in order to prepare for upcoming competitions. Additional meetings are scheduled on an as-needed basis. As we prepare for tournaments there is still plenty to do, including fund-raising, developing game strategies, scouting and further refinements to the hardware and software and driver training. Students are required to attend and participate in at least 75% of the meetings hours during the competition season. At the end of the competition season the robot and the team travel to the regional competition in Calgary. Typically, the team will compete in the Canada Western Regional FRC in Calgary but the team may also participate in additional competitions (in different locations) and, if we qualify, participate in the International Championships in St. Louis in mid to late April. This is the height and excitement of the FRC season!</p>

<p>Most <em>FIRST</em> regional events take place between Thursday and Saturday in a week in March. Thursday is typically a practice day where matches take place but do not count towards final standings. All day Friday and on Saturday morning, teams participate in qualifying matches. On Saturday afternoon, after the qualification matches have ended, the top eight ranked teams will pick partners from any team ranked below them, and the resulting alliances will compete to be regional winner. The top teams pick their partners starting with the top-ranked team, proceeding to the 8th ranked team, then back from the 8th team to the 1st team again. The alliances picked this way then proceed into elimination rounds, set up into quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. Each quarterfinal, semifinal, and final is determined by a best-of-3 matchup between the two alliances. All three teams in an alliance that wins a regional earns a reserved spot at the championship event, which in 
2011 to 2014, was held in St. Louis, Missouri. During competitions, teams have a “pit” in which they do between-game repairs and enhancements. There is also a subset of teams who will watch other teams and scout their competition. This allows students to learn on-the-fly strategy and design, as well as 
thinking on their feet in-game. Drivers of the robot deal with a variety of input and have to 
make complex decisions in 2-3 minutes.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Post-season (May - August)" id="postseason" %}
<p>During the post-season the team meets usually once a week, but additional meetings may be scheduled on an as-needed basis, e.g. for outreach activities and recruitment of sponsors. This post-season period is used for debriefing and follow up to the competitions, training, fundraising, community outreach and several other aspects that we cannot get done during the build and competition season. Students are required to participate in three required community outreach projects (<strong>Which ones?</strong>), two additional outreach events of their choice (the activity has to be pre-approved by the Management Team) and attend at least 60% of team meetings hours during this season. Summer is a great time to get started on activities and projects prior to pre-season, and a good time to do robot demos, fund-raising and community service. All students and mentors will be evaluated at the end of the school year and will receive notification about their roles for the next season. The Management Team will be formed at the end of the competition season to take full advantage of the summer to plan the next season.</p>
