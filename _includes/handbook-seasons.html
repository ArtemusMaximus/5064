<p>The meeting schedules are posted on the teams facebook group (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/opcomrobotics/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/opcomrobotics/</a>). The team meets year-round with varying frequency by the seasons. The various FRC seasons are the pre-season, build season, competition season, and post-season. Students are required to be activelly involved during all seasons to optimize their experience on the team and to prepare for the critical build and competition season. We recruit new students and mentors throughout the year and require both students and mentors to commit for a minimum of a whole year.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Pre-season (September to December)" id="preseason" %}
<p>The team uses the pre-season for team building, work session, fundraising, outreach, community service, and to acquire the necessary technical and programming skills for the upcoming build season. Students are required to attend at least 60% of the meeting hours during the pre-season.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Build season (January - mid-February)" id="buildseason" %}
<p>The build season consists of six weeks following the kick-off (when the game is revealed) starting at the beginning of January during which the team designs, builds, and programs the robot. Driver training also takes place during this time. The build season is the busiest time of year with meetings taking place at least three times a week, but often more, including during weekends. Additional meetings are scheduled on an as-needed basis for the various subgroups. It is important for all students and mentors to attend these meeting since we only have a short amount of time to create, debug a working robot and driver training. Due to this short time period students are required to attend and participate in at least 90% of the meeting hours during the build season.</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Competition (mid-February â€“ end of April)" id="competitionseason" %}
<p>During the competition season meeting times usually follow the build season schedule in order to prepare for upcoming competitions. Additional meetings are scheduled on an as-needed basis. As we prepare for tournaments there is still plenty to do, including fund-raising, developing game strategies, scouting and further refinements to the hardware and software and driver training. Students are required to attend and participate in at least 75% of the meetings hours during the competition season. At the end of the competition season the robot and the team travel to the regional competition in Calgary. Typically, the team will compete in the Canada Western Regional FRC in Calgary but the team may also participate in additional competitions (in different locations) and, if we qualify, participate in the International Championships in St. Louis in mid to late April. This is the height and excitement of the FRC season!</p>

{% include h4.html txt="Post-season (May - August)" id="postseason" %}
<p>During the post-season the team meets usually once a week, but additional meetings may be scheduled on an as-needed basis, e.g. for outreach activities and recruitment of sponsors. This post-season period is used for debriefing and follow up to the competitions, training, fundraising, community outreach and several other aspects that we cannot get done during the build and competition season. Students are required to participate in three required community outreach projects (<strong>Which ones?</strong>), two additional outreach events of their choice (the activity has to be pre-approved by the Management Team) and attend at least 60% of team meetings hours during this season. Summer is a great time to get started on activities and projects prior to pre-season, and a good time to do robot demos, fund-raising and community service. All students and mentors will be evaluated at the end of the school year and will receive notification about their roles for the next season. The Management Team will be formed at the end of the competition season to take full advantage of the summer to plan the next season.</p>
