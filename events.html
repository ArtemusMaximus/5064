<p>An important part of our teams efforts is to participate in robotics competitions, outreach work showing off our robot and community service. Do you want to meet us and see our robot in action, come to one of our meetings (<a href="/calendar">check out our calendar</a> for the next meeting) or one of our public outreach events.</p>
